project on pairs trading through linear regression method 
so what i have done is i first research for pairs that are tradable in my reserach notebook i have three research notebook in my project 2015,2016,2017 what i have done in each research notebook is i look at lastsix mpnths of data for that particular year for example in 2015 research notebook i i have used last six months of data to find tradable pairs now i will trade theses pairs in 2016 so runa backtests code for these pairs in 2016 and then to find pairs to trade for 2017 i have 2016 research notebook where i find tradble pairs from 2016 last sis months of data
so how reserach is bieng done so as for pair to be tradable its spread dhould be mean reverting means it5 should be cointigrated so i do i have separted stocks sectors wise and then i make pairs out of them then i run linear regression on each pair then i calculate the spread of the pair by using the pair beta and then once spread is calulated for that particular pair i have run augumented dickey fuller test to test the sationarity of the spread but i have added twist instead of running these test in on point in time deciding ok these are the pairs i will trade what i have done is run all these teset on rolling basis so i run linearn regression on rolling basis for 90 days and then calculat the spread every day based on rolling beta and then running adf test on rolling basis so we get rolling adf tstat value wich will tell us how robust is the cointigration
